AVFZK – Site Structure Documentation

This document describes the logical structure of the AVFZK website
and how content is organized for discoverability and indexing.

--------------------------------------------------

Core Sections

The platform is organized into the following top-level sections:

- Home / New Updates
- Actress Directory
- Area Index
- Genre Index
- Daily Availability
- Popular Profiles

Each section acts as an entry point for deeper navigation.

--------------------------------------------------

URL Structure

Clean and readable URLs are used throughout the site.

Navigation Design

- Breadcrumb navigation is implemented on internal pages
- Internal links connect actresses, genres, and areas
- Crawl depth is intentionally kept shallow

Structured Data

JSON-LD is used to describe:

- Actress profiles (Person)
- Listing pages (ItemList)
- Breadcrumb navigation (BreadcrumbList)

This helps search engines understand page relationships.
